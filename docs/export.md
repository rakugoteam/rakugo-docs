# How to Setup Export for Godot project that use Rakugo

## HTML5 export now works on itch.io with Firefox

Some time ago Rakugo wasn’t working on itch.io with Firefox for html5 export, because we use multi-threading feature. It wasn’t handled on this website. It is now resolved by itch.io!

## For Any Export

For any type of export, we need add RakuScript  *`*.rk`* files to export settings as by default, only files not recognized by Godot are ignored.
