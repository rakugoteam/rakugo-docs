# RakuScript

**RakuScript** is Rakugo Dialogue scripting language inspired by Ren'Py Scripting Language.

You can use with **RakuScriptDialogue** node or using:

```gdscript
Rakugo.parse_script("path/to/raku_script.rk")
```

## Full Example

## Character

```character [char_tag] [char_name]```

Equivalent in GDScript:

```gdscript
Rakugo.define_character(char_tag, char_name)
```

Create/Define a new character with this char_tag and char_name

### Example

```character Gd Godot```

## Variable

```renpy
# set variable
[var_name] = [value]

# get variable
[other_var_name]

# get variable from character
[char_tag].[var_name]
```

Equivalent in GDScript:

```gdscript
# set variable
Rakugo.set_variable(var_name, value)

# get variable
Rakugo.get_variable(other_var_name)

 # get variable from character
Rakugo.get_variable(char_tag.var_name)
```

Create a new variable with this var_name and this value assigned.

A var_name should be 2 or more characters long ( [Issue is already opened and we work on fixing it](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo/issues/93) ).

If other_var_name or char_tag.var_name is defined, use value of other_var_name or char_tag.var_name.

If this variable already exist, value is replaced by new one.

### Variable Example

```renpy

# create / set variable
life = 5

# assign value form other variable
life = max_life

# assign value from character
life = Gd.max_life

```

## Character's Variables

```renpy
# set variable
[char_tag].[var_name] = [value]

# get variable from character
[char_tag].[var_name]
```

Create a new variable with this var_name on character with this char_tag, and this value assigned.

If other_var_name or char_tag.var_name is defined, use value of other_var_name or char_tag.var_name.

If this variable already exist on this character, value is replaced by new one.

### Variables Example

```renpy
# create / set character variable
Gd.friendship = 5

# assign value from other variable
Gd.friendship = max_friendship

# assign value from character
Gd.friendship = Gd.max_friendship
```

## Say

```[char_tag] [String]```

Character with this char_tag say *String*

When Say is executed, a signal [say] is send with dictionary of data for the character with this char_tag and this String in parameter.

If no character with this char_tag is found, signal is send with an empty dictionary.

After Say is executed, Rakugo automatically waiting, it send a [step] signal.

### Say Example

```renpy
Gd "Hello !"
```

### No character

```[String]```

Say *String*

When Say is executed, a signal [say] is send with empty dictionary and this String in parameter.

### No character Example

```"Hello, world !"```

### Use variables

```<[var_name]> or <[char_tag].[var_name]>```

You can use variables in Say, Rakugo replace them by their values in String before send signal [say].

### Example of use variables

```renpy
"My name is <Gd.name>, and I have <life> point of life"
```

## Ask

```renpy
[var_name] = ? [question]
```

```renpy
[var_name] = ? [question] [placeholder]
```

```renpy
[var_name] = ? [character_tag] [question] [placeholder]

```

It can be used get user input as string,
for example you can use it to ask user for a his/her/their name.

After a Ask is executed, Rakugo waiting call of [ask_return] signal:

```gdscript
Rakugo.ask_return(answer)
```

### Ask Examples

```renpy
player.name = ? "What is your name ?"
player.age = ? "How old are you ?"
```

## Menu

It can be used to create a ui that switches between different branches
of dialogue tree.

```renpy
menu menu_emily:
  "Talk with emily" > emily_talk
  "Wait"
  "Blop" > test_dialog

```

It must start it from menu menu_name:
`"Choice"` - is choice and `>` is used to jump to other dialog/label or menu.
Menu block ends with empty line.

After a Menu is executed, Rakugo waiting call of [ask_menu] signal:

```gdscript
Rakugo.ask_menu(branch_index)
```

## Jump

```renpy
jump [label_name] or jump [menu_label_name]
```

It will jump dialogue branch with given label_name or menu_label_name.

### Jump Example

```renpy
jump start

jump shop_menu
```

### Jump If

```renpy
jump [label_name] if [condition]
```

It will jump dialogue branch with given
label_name or menu_label_name if condition is true.

### Jump If Example

```renpy
jump emily_date if emily.relationship >= 20
```
